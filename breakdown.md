Programming Languages/Frameworks I think are cool

- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Elixir
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Phoenix
- React/React Native
- Python
- Rust
- Ruby/Ruby on Rails


- could be really cool to make a cmd tool that will init each type of project with a quick reminder of the syntax and relevant commands.

- could be cool to make a rapid article that explains each programming language so you can stop thinking about "what language to learn"
